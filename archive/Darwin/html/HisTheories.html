              of the biggest and most important happenings that helped shape Charles 
              Darwin's theories was the five year trip (1831-1836) aboard the 
              H.M.S. Beagle. Riding on the ship as a naturalist, he collected 
              specimens and observations as the ship traveled along the south 
              sides of South America, Australia, and Africa. He started this voyage 
              when he was 22 right after graduating, with a degree in theology, 
              from Cambridge University. It was on this trip where he affirmed 
              that evolution did occur.<img src="../images/Darwin_finches.gif" width="400" height="75" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" usemap="#Map" border="0"><map name="Map"><area shape="rect" coords="0,0,399,78" href="#" alt="Finches  with different beak sizes from the galapagos" title="Finches  with different beak sizes from the galapagos"></map>
              One of the most important places he visited was the Galapagos Islands, 
              located in the Pacific Ocean near the west coast of South America. 
              Because of it's remoteness, entire species could be found on different 
              islands. Darwin found 13 species of finches (compared to the one 
              he knew about in South America). He also dug up fossils alike to 
              those of species now. Like the finches, he found many plant and 
              animal variations similar to those in South America. </font></font></p>
            <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
              he got home, he went through all his notes, and came up with four 
              interlacing theories: that there was evolution, that evolving was 
              gradual, taking millions of years, the main thing that helped evolution 
              was a process called natural selection, and the modern species we 
              have around now evolved from from one organism using a process called 
              specialization.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">After 
              Charles Darwin's death, a Lady Hope said that he denied evolution 
              on his deathbed and converted to Christianity, a story that was 
              printed in the local newspaper. Charles Darwin's daughter revealed 
              this story to be false, though, when she stated that she had been 
              there and he had said no such thing.</font></p>
