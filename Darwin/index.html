						<p class="Quote">Charles Darwin may not have started the evolution revolution, and he certainly did not end it, but he was the main cornerstone that many other theories rested upon.
						</p>
						
            <p class="Paragraph">Charles Darwin, extremist extraordinaire, simply 
              surprised England when he released his first book, <b><i> On the 
              Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation 
              of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life</i></b>, in 1859. He angered 
              and amazed them when his second book came out, <i><b>The Descent 
              of Man </b></i>in 1871. It was easy to read, if not accept, about 
              the evolution of other creatures; but to say that the human race, 
              supreme over all other animals had evolved from apes, was too much 
              for 18th century England. Darwin was accused of heresy all his life, 
              but more so after this book.</p>
