            <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
              where many famous people in history who were not liked or believed 
              in their own time. Charles Darwin is a wonderful example. He was 
              afraid at first to come out <img src="../images/moths.gif" width="212" height="167" align="right" usemap="#Map2" border="0"><map name="Map2"><area shape="rect" coords="1,1,216,213" href="#" alt="moths that have evolved to fit their habitat" title="moths that have evolved to fit their habitat"></map>and
              tell the world his ideas. It eventually took a young scientist named 
              Alfred Wallace who was steadily catching up on his theories.( Darwin 
              did come up with them first). That finally convinced Darwin to go 
              public, and even then his theories aren't taken seriously. Some 
              people just wouldn't believe him, <img src="../images/map_of_Galapagos_Islands.gif" width="172" height="280" align="left" usemap="#Map3" border="0"><map name="Map3"><area shape="rect" coords="0,6,205,309" href="#" alt="a map of the Galapagos" title="a map of the Galapagos"></map>some
              people bend his ideas to make it some way to advertise for racism 
              (they say that some people are less evolved, such as poor people). 
              All in all, it was very hard for Darwin. </font></p>
            <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Charles 
              Darwin must have been thinking ahead of his time, to come up with 
              an idea so new. But it wasn't as new as many people think. The idea 
              of evolution had been around for a very long time. Darwin had just 
              thought of a theory on how it occurred, which is still quite a lot.</font></p>
