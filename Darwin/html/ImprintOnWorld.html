            <p><font size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
              Christians, and many other religion followers, Darwin's books had 
              a radical new idea. Others opposed evolution, because it conflicted 
              with their religious thought. Darwin was influenced by ideas of 
              other evolutionists from the late 1700's, and his granddad, Erasmus 
              Darwin.<img src="../images/rhea.jpg" width="175" height="239" align="right">
              He was often called the Father of evolution, and was named after 
              his Uncle. Darwin thought his voyage on the H.M.S. Beagle the most 
              important happening in his life. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4">It 
              was very controversial for Darwin. His theory said that the organisms 
              of today are resulted from billions of years of evolving. It implied 
              that humans, like every other animal in the world, had evolved from 
              muck. The idea was not pleasing. Plus, it conflicted with the idea 
              that each and every animal was perfect. This was one of the facts 
              that had helped prove there was a god.</font></p>
